### Abstract
In-situ transmission electron microscopy (in-situ TEM) is widely used to explore various electrochemical processes at the nanoscale to comprehend the underlying mechanisms and improve performances of many electrochemical applications ranging from batteries, electrocatalyst to polymer conducting fuel cells. In-situ electrochemical studies in TEM are generally conducted using micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) based chips with three patterned conducting electrodes. The most commonly utilized electrode material is Platinum (Pt). However, due to its low electron transparency and high catalytic activity, the practical application of Pt in many electrochemical processes is limited. This study presents new electrode material, i.e. Titanium Nitride (TiNx) as alternative to Pt, to clearly investigate the targeted electrochemical reactions. Using Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) electroplating experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the TiNx electrode in terms of visibility of the plated materials on top of the electrodes, the stability of electrical stimuli compared to the Pt electrode and the possibility of accurate quantification. TiNx electrode can be a good alternative to Pt electrode and, in some cases, even glassy carbon for electrochemical investigations using in-situ liquid phase microscopy.
