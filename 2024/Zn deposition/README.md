### Abstract
Despite the potential of liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) to understand electrochemical reactions such as zinc (Zn) aqueous batteries, it is largely limited to measurements with low-resolution and little-to-no quantification. Here, by performing LPTEM of Zn electrodeposition and analyzing the data via simple image processing we shed light on the dendrite growth mechanism. We further demonstrate that from the basic scanning transmission electron microcopy (STEM) time series, the dendrite growth can be visualized with volumetric and growth rate information. These results along with additionally corroborated 4D STEM analysis shines light on the crystallographic orientation of the grown Zn nucleates and take a step towards live processing of in-situ electrodeposition.
