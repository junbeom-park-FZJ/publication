> Hello, As a material engineer, I have an interests on improving the material and process via investigating the fundamental mechanism.
My experience began from material synthesis (carbon nanotube fiber via floating catalyst method) and material analysis (morphology, structural arrangement, crystallinity and mechanical properties). After that, I shifted to the in-situ TEM technique, which enables to investigate the variety of material's properties (ex. phase, crystallinity, composition) or process (ex. agglomeration, electrodeposition) related to environmental conditions (ex. temperature, gas pressure, electricity). Additionally, I started image and data processing (ex. segmentation, edge detection) to extract more information from in-situ results.
